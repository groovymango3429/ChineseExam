Criticism of Chinese tradition from Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi

Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi were two of the most influential figures in the New Culture Movement of the early twentieth century, and their criticism of Chinese tradition represented a radical break from previous reform efforts. Unlike earlier reformers such as Kang Youwei who sought to preserve Confucianism while modernizing China, Chen and Hu argued that traditional Chinese culture, particularly Confucianism, was the fundamental obstacle to China's progress. Their attacks on Chinese tradition were comprehensive, targeting not just specific practices but the underlying values and worldview of traditional civilization. While they shared a commitment to cultural transformation, they differed in their approaches, with Chen being more radical and revolutionary while Hu was more scholarly and reformist. Together, their critiques helped shape the intellectual climate that would contribute to profound social and political changes in twentieth century China.

Chen Duxiu's criticism of Chinese tradition was rooted in his conviction that Confucianism was incompatible with modernity and democracy. As founder and editor of New Youth magazine, Chen launched fierce attacks on traditional culture, arguing that it promoted values antithetical to developing a modern nation. He criticized Confucianism for emphasizing hierarchy, obedience, and conformity rather than equality, individual rights, and critical thinking. Chen argued that Confucian emphasis on filial piety and loyalty created a culture of subservience that prevented Chinese people from developing independent spirit necessary for democratic citizenship. He attacked the traditional family system as despotic and oppressive, particularly toward women and youth, arguing it stifled individual development. Chen famously called for democracy and science, which he termed Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science, as solutions to China's problems, explicitly contrasting these with traditional Chinese values. He argued that China could not become modern by grafting Western institutions onto Chinese cultural foundations, but needed to transform its fundamental values and worldview. Chen's critique extended to concrete social practices including traditional marriage customs, subordination of women, the examination system, and classical Chinese literature, all of which he saw as manifestations of backward feudal culture keeping China weak.

Hu Shi's criticism of Chinese tradition, while equally comprehensive, was more scholarly than Chen's polemical attacks. As a Columbia trained philosopher who studied under John Dewey, Hu brought systematic analytical approach to critiquing tradition. His critique focused on the Chinese mode of thinking compared to Western scientific methods. Hu argued that traditional Chinese thought lacked rigor, precision, and systematic methodology, relying on intuition and analogy rather than logical argumentation. Hu attacked the traditional educational system and its emphasis on memorization rather than independent thinking. He argued that classical Chinese language itself hindered clear thinking and precise communication. This led Hu to become a leading advocate of the literary revolution, promoting vernacular Chinese as the medium for modern literature and education. He believed that replacing classical Chinese with vernacular language was essential for democratizing education and enabling logical thinking. His essay on literary revolution argued that classical Chinese literature had become ossified and that Chinese writers needed to create new literature in vernacular language expressing modern ideas.

Both Chen and Hu also criticized what they saw as the anti-scientific character of traditional Chinese culture. They argued that traditional Chinese thought emphasized moral and aesthetic categories rather than causal explanation and empirical investigation. Chen attacked traditional superstitions and religious practices, arguing that China's weakness stemmed partly from its failure to develop modern science. Hu Shi similarly emphasized the need for scientific method and critical thinking. He promoted his approach of bold hypothesis and careful verification as a model for both scholarly research and practical problem solving. Both thinkers saw the introduction of modern scientific thought as essential not just for technological development but for transforming Chinese modes of thinking. They believed that scientific rationality needed to replace traditional modes of thought based on authority, precedent, and moral intuition.

The criticism of tradition by Chen and Hu was not purely negative. Both believed that criticizing tradition was necessary to clear ground for constructing a new Chinese culture appropriate for the modern world. They were interested in creating a new culture that would combine the best of Western civilization, particularly science and democracy, with whatever elements of Chinese tradition could be adapted to modern conditions. However, they insisted that this synthesis could only occur after thorough critical examination of tradition rather than uncritical preservation. Their approach represented critical iconoclasm, a willingness to question everything in traditional culture while remaining open to preserving valuable elements. Hu Shi, in particular, emphasized the importance of systematic study of Chinese tradition using modern scholarly methods. His work on the history of Chinese philosophy and literature aimed to understand Chinese tradition scientifically rather than reverentially.

The impact of Chen and Hu's criticism was profound and controversial. Their ideas, disseminated through New Youth magazine, influenced an entire generation of Chinese intellectuals and students, particularly during and after the May Fourth Movement of nineteen nineteen. Their critique helped delegitimize Confucianism as the unquestioned foundation of Chinese culture and opened space for consideration of radical alternatives, including Western thought and eventually Marxism. However, their attacks also provoked strong opposition from conservatives who saw them as destroying Chinese cultural identity and from later critics who argued that wholesale rejection of tradition was neither possible nor desirable. Some accused them of being too iconoclastic and failing to appreciate valuable elements within Chinese tradition. Others argued that their embrace of Western values amounted to cultural imperialism.

Despite these criticisms, the fundamental challenge that Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi posed to Chinese tradition had lasting effects. They established that tradition should be subject to critical examination rather than uncritical acceptance, that modernity required not just technological adoption but cultural transformation, and that Chinese intellectuals needed to engage seriously with Western ideas. Their work helped create the intellectual conditions for the more radical political and social changes that would follow in twentieth century China, even as debates continued about how to balance preservation of cultural identity with necessary modernization. The tension they identified between tradition and modernity remains relevant today in China and other societies grappling with modernization while maintaining cultural continuity.
