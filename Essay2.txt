Kang Youwei's culturalism and Liang Qichao's nationalism

The intellectual relationship between Kang Youwei and his student Liang Qichao represents a significant transition in modern Chinese political thought, specifically the shift from culturalism to nationalism. While both sought to strengthen China and reform its institutions, they differed fundamentally in how they conceived of Chinese identity and the principles organizing political life. Kang's culturalism emphasized universal values and the spread of Chinese civilization beyond ethnic boundaries, while Liang's nationalism focused on the state, citizenship, and the competitive international order. This difference reflected broader changes in how Chinese intellectuals understood their place in the world and modern political community.

Kang Youwei's culturalism was rooted in the traditional Chinese worldview that understood civilization in terms of cultural refinement rather than ethnic or territorial identity. For Kang, what made someone Chinese was participation in Chinese culture, particularly Confucian values and practices. This perspective had deep historical roots in imperial China's self-conception as the center of civilization. Kang's culturalism was shaped by his interpretation of Confucianism, especially his focus on Confucius as a visionary reformer who taught universal principles applicable to all humanity. In his major work, the Book of Great Unity, Kang envisioned a future world government based on Confucian principles where distinctions of nation, race, and class would eventually dissolve. This utopian vision reflected a culturalist assumption that values associated with Chinese civilization had universal validity and could provide the basis for global harmony. Kang's culturalism also informed his practical political proposals, including his effort to establish Confucianism as a state religion that could serve as the spiritual foundation for a reformed China. He believed that Confucian values could provide both national cohesion and universal moral guidance. This culturalist perspective made Kang somewhat indifferent to specific territorial boundaries. What mattered was the preservation and spread of Chinese cultural values, not necessarily the political unity or sovereignty of a particular territory. Kang's thinking thus maintained continuity with premodern Chinese universalism even as he sought institutional transformation.

Liang Qichao's nationalism represented a fundamental break from this culturalist tradition and reflected his exposure to Western political thought and the harsh realities of international competition. After fleeing China following the failure of the Hundred Days Reform, Liang encountered nationalist movements and theories during his exile in Japan and travels in the West. He came to understand that in the modern world, political communities were organized as nation-states that competed for survival and power in an international system. This realization led Liang to emphasize the nation rather than culture as the primary unit of political organization and loyalty. For Liang, China needed to transform itself from a cultural entity into a modern nation-state with clearly defined citizenship, territorial sovereignty, and national consciousness. He introduced and popularized many concepts related to nationalism in Chinese discourse, including the idea of the nation, citizenship, national character, and public virtue. Liang's nationalism was not simply about asserting Chinese cultural superiority but about building state capacity and fostering the civic virtues necessary for national survival. He emphasized that Chinese people needed to develop a sense of public morality and collective responsibility that extended beyond family and clan to encompass the entire nation. This required transforming Chinese identity from one based on cultural participation to one based on citizenship in a nation-state.

The differences between Kang's culturalism and Liang's nationalism had profound implications for how each conceived of reform and China's relationship with the world. Kang's culturalism made him more concerned with preserving and reforming Confucian values and institutions, believing that if these were properly revitalized, China would naturally regain its strength and fulfill its civilizational mission. His focus on establishing Confucianism as a state religion reflected this culturalist priority. In contrast, Liang's nationalism made him more pragmatic about cultural tradition. While he respected Confucian values, he was willing to advocate for their modification or even abandonment if they hindered the development of national strength and civic virtues necessary for survival in the international system. Liang emphasized the need for education to produce citizens who understood their rights and responsibilities, for a legal system that protected individual rights and promoted social order, and for political institutions that could mobilize national resources effectively. He was less interested in cultural authenticity than in practical effectiveness for state building.

Another crucial difference lay in their understanding of China's place in the world. Kang's culturalism maintained a sense of Chinese civilizational superiority even as he advocated learning from the West. He saw Western institutions as potentially useful but ultimately believed that Confucian values were superior and would eventually spread globally. His vision of the Great Unity was cosmopolitan but centered on Chinese cultural principles. Liang's nationalism, however, accepted the reality of a multipolar world of competing nations where China had no guaranteed special status. He emphasized that China needed to compete with other nations on their terms, adopting whatever institutions and practices were necessary for national survival and prosperity. This more realistic assessment of international relations made Liang more open to Western ideas and institutions, not because they were culturally superior but because they appeared more effective for building modern state power.

The transition from Kang's culturalism to Liang's nationalism paralleled broader changes in Chinese intellectual life and represented a crucial step in China's political modernization. While Kang's culturalism offered continuity with traditional Chinese self-understanding, it struggled to provide practical solutions for China's immediate challenges in a world of nation-states. Liang's nationalism, though it required accepting China as one nation among many rather than the center of civilization, offered a more realistic framework for understanding international relations and mobilizing collective action. This shift from culturalism to nationalism was not unique to China but occurred throughout the non-Western world as societies confronted Western power and the modern state system. The difference between Kang and Liang thus illustrates one of the central transformations of modern Chinese thought, the reimagining of Chinese identity from cultural community to political nation, a transformation that continues to shape Chinese politics today.
