Kang Youwei's effort to make Confucianism as a national religion

Kang Youwei's campaign to establish Confucianism as the national religion of China represents one of the most ambitious and controversial aspects of his reform program in the late Qing and early Republican periods. This effort reveals both the innovative and conservative dimensions of Kang's thought, as well as the challenges facing Chinese intellectuals who sought to modernize China while preserving cultural continuity. Kang's religious project was motivated by multiple concerns, including the need to provide spiritual cohesion for a modernizing nation, to protect Chinese culture from Western and Christian influence, and to legitimate political reform through traditional authority. However, his attempt to transform Confucianism into a formal religion modeled on Western Christianity proved deeply problematic and ultimately unsuccessful, revealing fundamental tensions in his approach to tradition and modernity.

Kang's motivation for establishing Confucianism as a state religion stemmed from his observation of Western societies, where Christianity provided moral foundations and social cohesion. He believed religion was essential for any strong nation because it unified people around shared values and gave them higher purpose beyond material interests. Looking at China's situation, Kang worried that traditional Confucian teachings, while influential, lacked the institutional structure and emotional appeal of organized religion. As China opened to the West, Christian missionaries gained converts, and Kang feared that without a strong institutional response, Chinese culture would be undermined. He recognized that in modern constitutional systems, religion and state were separated, yet religion remained an important source of social values and morality. Kang therefore sought to transform Confucianism from an ethical tradition into an organized religion with formal institutions, rituals, and clergy that could compete with Christianity and provide spiritual guidance for modernizing China.

Kang's conception of Confucian religion drew heavily on his distinctive interpretation of Confucius and the Confucian tradition. Rather than seeing Confucius as merely a transmitter of ancient wisdom, Kang portrayed him as a religious founder and prophet who had established comprehensive teaching for human salvation. This interpretation was grounded in Kang's emphasis on the New Text school, which viewed many classical texts as later fabrications and emphasized Confucius's role as an active reformer. Kang argued that Confucius had created the Six Classics to convey his vision of an ideal society and that the true teaching had been obscured over centuries by orthodox interpreters who emphasized ritual and hierarchy over the original humanistic message. By reinterpreting Confucius as a religious founder with transformative vision, Kang could claim that establishing Confucianism as a religion was restoration rather than innovation. This interpretive strategy allowed Kang to advocate for religious institutionalization while maintaining traditional legitimacy.

The specific proposals that Kang advanced for institutionalizing Confucianism included several key elements modeled on Western religious practices. He called for construction of Confucian temples throughout China that would serve as places of regular worship and education, similar to Christian churches. He advocated for establishment of a Confucian clergy with formal training who would lead religious services, perform rituals, and provide moral instruction. Kang proposed that Confucianism should be explicitly recognized in the constitution as the national religion. He wanted Confucian religious education to be mandatory in schools, ensuring that all Chinese citizens would be grounded in Confucian values. He also advocated for standardization of Confucian rituals and ceremonies, including regular worship services, holidays, and life-cycle ceremonies that would give Confucianism the emotional and communal dimensions of organized religion. These proposals reflected Kang's belief that Confucianism needed to adapt its form to modern conditions while preserving essential content.

However, Kang's religious project faced substantial criticism and ultimately failed. One fundamental problem was that Confucianism had never been a religion in the Western sense and transforming it into one required distorting its essential character. Traditional Confucianism was primarily an ethical and social philosophy focused on human relationships, moral cultivation, and proper governance rather than supernatural beliefs or salvation. While Confucianism included ritual practices and veneration of ancestors and sages, these were expressions of respect rather than religious worship. Many Chinese intellectuals objected to forcing Confucianism into a Western religious mold. Conservative scholars argued that Kang's reinterpretation was historically unfounded and would corrupt authentic Confucian teaching. Progressive intellectuals, particularly those associated with the New Culture Movement, criticized Kang's project as an attempt to preserve outdated traditions hindering modernization. They argued that China needed to break free from Confucian orthodoxy rather than institutionalize it further, and that establishing Confucianism as a state religion would stifle intellectual freedom and social progress.

The political context also worked against Kang's religious project. After the fall of the Qing dynasty in nineteen eleven, China entered a period of political fragmentation where no single group had authority to establish a state religion. The early Republic was marked by competition among various political factions and ideological movements with different visions for China's future. While some traditionalist politicians sympathized with Kang's goals, they lacked power to implement his proposals nationally. Moreover, the broader intellectual tide was moving against Confucianism. The May Fourth Movement and New Culture Movement explicitly attacked Confucianism as the source of China's weakness, calling for its replacement with science and democracy. In this environment, Kang's attempt to establish Confucianism as a state religion appeared increasingly anachronistic.

Despite its failure, Kang's religious project reveals important dimensions of the challenge facing Chinese reformers. His effort illustrated the difficulty of preserving cultural identity while adopting modern institutions, as his attempt to make Confucianism more like Western religion arguably betrayed its distinctive character. It also showed how traditional discourse could be mobilized for reform purposes, as Kang used Confucian rhetoric to advocate for substantial changes. Finally, Kang's project demonstrated the limits of cultural synthesis, as his attempt to combine Chinese content with Western form satisfied neither traditionalists nor progressives. The failure of his religious project contributed to the broader crisis of Confucianism in modern China and the eventual rise of more radical alternatives like Marxism that promised to break with tradition rather than reform it. Yet Kang's vision of using traditional culture as a source of national identity and moral guidance continues to resonate in contemporary discussions about Chinese values and cultural development.
