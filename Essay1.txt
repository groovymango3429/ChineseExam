Substance and function in Zhang Zhidong, Kang Youwei, and Yan Fu

The debate over substance and function, or ti-yong in Chinese, became one of the most crucial intellectual discussions during China's tumultuous modernization period in the late Qing dynasty. This philosophical framework attempted to reconcile traditional Chinese values with Western knowledge and technology, addressing the fundamental question of how China could modernize while preserving its cultural identity. Three prominent intellectuals, Zhang Zhidong, Kang Youwei, and Yan Fu, each offered distinct interpretations of this relationship, reflecting their varying degrees of reform ambitions and their understanding of what constituted the essence of Chinese civilization versus the practical tools needed for national survival.

Zhang Zhidong, representing the moderate reform position, articulated the famous formula Chinese learning as substance, Western learning for function. This approach attempted to maintain a clear separation between the spiritual and moral foundation of Chinese civilization and the practical technologies of the West. For Zhang, the substance referred to the Confucian moral and social order, including the three bonds and five relationships that structured Chinese society, as well as the cultivation of virtue and the maintenance of social harmony. He believed these fundamental values and social structures were superior and should remain unchanged. The function, on the other hand, encompassed Western science, technology, military techniques, and practical knowledge that could strengthen China without corrupting its moral core. Zhang's formulation was essentially conservative, arguing that China could adopt Western tools and methods while keeping its cultural essence intact. He advocated for learning Western mathematics, natural sciences, military technology, and industrial production methods, but insisted that these should serve to protect and preserve Chinese values rather than transform them. This position was pragmatic and appealing to many traditional elites because it promised modernization without fundamental social or cultural upheaval.

However, Kang Youwei's approach to substance and function was far more radical and transformative. Rather than accepting the traditional ti-yong dichotomy, Kang fundamentally reinterpreted what constituted Chinese substance itself. Through his innovative reinterpretation of Confucianism, particularly his emphasis on the New Text school and his reading of Confucius as a reformer rather than a transmitter of ancient tradition, Kang argued that the true substance of Chinese thought was actually progressive and democratic in nature. He challenged Zhang Zhidong's conservative interpretation by suggesting that genuine Confucian substance was compatible with, and even demanded, institutional reforms similar to those in the West. For Kang, the substance was not the existing social order but rather the original progressive spirit of Confucianism that had been corrupted over centuries. This allowed him to advocate for constitutional monarchy, institutional reforms, and even elements of democracy while claiming to preserve Chinese essence. Kang's solution to the substance-function problem was thus revolutionary because it redefined the substance itself to make it compatible with Western political institutions and ideas. He argued that adopting Western political systems, educational reforms, and social changes was not a betrayal of Chinese substance but rather a return to its true meaning. This intellectual maneuver allowed him to advocate for comprehensive reform while maintaining cultural legitimacy through Confucian rhetoric.

Yan Fu took yet another distinctive approach to the substance-function debate, one that was more philosophically sophisticated and ultimately more subversive to traditional Chinese thought. Unlike Zhang's clear separation or Kang's creative reinterpretation, Yan Fu questioned whether substance and function could truly be separated at all. Through his translations and commentaries on Western works, particularly those of Thomas Huxley, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer, Yan introduced Chinese intellectuals to Western philosophy, political economy, and social theory. His key insight was that Western strength and prosperity were not merely the result of superior technology but were rooted in fundamental philosophical and social principles, including individual liberty, competitive spirit, and rational inquiry. Yan argued that Western function, such as scientific and technological achievements, emerged from Western substance, meaning Western philosophical principles and social values. Therefore, if China wanted to adopt Western function effectively, it would need to understand and potentially adopt elements of Western substance as well. This position implicitly challenged the entire ti-yong framework that both Zhang and Kang had tried to work within. Yan's comparative studies revealed that the West had its own substance that produced its superior function, and he suggested that certain Western values, particularly regarding individual freedom, energy, and intelligence, might need to be adopted for China to truly modernize. While Yan remained concerned about preserving Chinese identity and did not advocate wholesale Westernization, his analysis made clear that meaningful modernization would require deeper cultural and philosophical changes than Zhang's formula allowed.

The differences among these three thinkers reflect not just varying political positions but fundamentally different understandings of culture, tradition, and change. Zhang represented the self-strengthening movement's hope that China could modernize on its own terms with minimal cultural disruption. His approach was ultimately shown to be insufficient, as technology transfer without institutional reform proved inadequate for comprehensive modernization. Kang's creative reinterpretation of Confucianism showed how traditional discourse could be mobilized for radical reform, though his particular synthesis was never fully realized in practice. Yan's deeper philosophical critique revealed the fundamental challenge that adopting modern institutions and technologies would inevitably affect values and worldviews, making a simple substance-function separation untenable. Together, these three positions illustrate the intellectual struggle of Chinese reformers to navigate between total rejection of tradition and stubborn resistance to change, seeking instead various forms of synthesis that could preserve cultural identity while enabling national survival and renewal. The substance-function debate thus became the central framework through which late Qing intellectuals grappled with modernity, and the different solutions proposed by Zhang, Kang, and Yan continue to inform discussions about cultural identity and modernization throughout the world today.
